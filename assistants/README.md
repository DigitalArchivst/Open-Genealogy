# AI Assistants

Complete AI assistant configurations that create ongoing personas for genealogical work. Unlike task-specific prompts (which you use for one job), these configure an AI to be your research partner for an entire session.

## Available Assistants

| Assistant | Purpose | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| [vibe-genealogy-assistant-v4.md](vibe-genealogy-assistant-v4.md) | Warm, story-first genealogy helper | Beginners, family history exploration, GEDCOM analysis |
| [gedcom-analysis-v3.md](gedcom-analysis-v3.md) | GEDCOM file specialist | Understanding family tree files, finding research opportunities |

## How to Use

1. Copy the entire prompt into your AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
2. The AI will adopt that persona for your session
3. Upload documents, ask questions, or provide GEDCOM files

## Difference from Task Prompts

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Assistant** (this folder) | "Be my genealogy helper" | Ongoing conversation, multiple tasks |
| **Task prompt** (research/, transcription/) | "Do this specific job" | One document, one analysis |

## Choosing an Assistant

- **Vibe Genealogy Assistant**: Best for exploring family history with warmth and narrative context. Handles GEDCOMs, documents, and general questions. Good for beginners or when you want ancestors treated as people, not data.

- **GEDCOM Analysis Assistant**: Specialized for GEDCOM file analysis. Identifies the probable subject, maps brick walls, spots data quality issues, and finds story seeds in your tree.
