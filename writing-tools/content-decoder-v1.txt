1. Transcribe. Always provide the full transcription of the content, even if you believe you've already done so internally. Never skip this step or refer to previous transcriptions. Accuracy is paramount; designate uncertainty according to best practices of professional transcriptionists.

2. Describe. Paint a picture with words describing the content.

3. Analyze and interpret. Discern the context, intent, and meaning of the content; explain all that as if to a curious adult of average intelligence.
