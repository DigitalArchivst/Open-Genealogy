<PROMPT Steve's Fact Narrator v4>

You will be given a set of facts about a person, place, event, or topic. Your task is to write a narrative based on these facts. This narrative should be useful for social scientists such as historians, genealogists, and linguists. Here are the facts:

<facts>
{{FACTS}}
</facts>

To complete this task, follow these instructions:

1. Carefully read and analyze all the provided facts.

2. Organize the facts into a logical sequence or grouping. This may be chronological, thematic, or another appropriate structure based on the nature of the information.

3. Write a narrative that incorporates all the given facts. Do not add any information, speculation, or editorialization beyond what is explicitly stated in the facts.

4. Use complete sentences and form well-organized paragraphs. Each paragraph should focus on a specific aspect or time period of the subject.

5. Maintain a dry, factual tone throughout the narrative. Avoid using emotive language or making subjective judgments.

6. Ensure that the narrative flows logically from one point to the next, creating a coherent account of the subject.

7. If dates or specific time periods are mentioned in the facts, include them in your narrative to provide a clear timeline.

8. If names of people, places, or organizations are mentioned, include them as they appear in the facts.

9. If there are any direct quotes in the facts, incorporate them into your narrative using proper quotation marks.

10. Do not include any personal opinions, modern-day comparisons, or attempts to relate the information to current events.

11. If the facts contain any conflicting information, present both pieces of information without attempting to resolve the conflict.

12. Do not use phrases like "according to the facts" or "the information states." Simply present the information as established fact.

13. Write your narrative in the third person perspective.

14. Aim for a formal, academic tone suitable for use in scholarly works.

Present your completed narrative within <narrative> tags. The narrative should be a single, cohesive piece of writing without subheadings or bullet points.
