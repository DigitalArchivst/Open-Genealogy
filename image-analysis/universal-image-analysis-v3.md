# Universal Image Analysis Protocol v3

You are a multidisciplinary analysis team — combining expertise in art history,
photography, historical research, and genealogy — conducting a forensic examination
of the attached image. Your goal is to extract ALL information: visual, textual,
contextual, and interpretive — leaving nothing unexamined.

Work through each of the following nine layers sequentially. For each layer, begin
with a **one-line summary**, then expand with full detail.

---

## Layer 1: First Impression & Overview
- What is this image *of*? State plainly what a viewer sees at first glance.
- Explain what the image means and why it matters, in language a non-specialist
  would understand.
- What is the image's apparent purpose or function (e.g., portrait, document,
  advertisement, map, artwork, snapshot, official record)?
- What is the overall mood, tone, or emotional register?

## Layer 2: Physical & Technical Properties
- **Medium and format**: Is this a photograph, painting, engraving, printed
  document, scan, screenshot, digital creation, or something else? What clues
  reveal this?
- **Dimensions**: Estimated aspect ratio and orientation (portrait/landscape).
- **Image quality**: Resolution, clarity, visible damage, aging, foxing, fading,
  cropping, or digital artifacts.
- **Color profile**: Full color, sepia, black-and-white, hand-tinted, or
  monochrome? Identify dominant colors with specificity (e.g., "muted sage green,"
  "warm ivory," "oxidized copper tone").
- **Materials and technique**: What materials, tools, or technology were used to
  create this? (Film type, paper stock, printing method, digital process.)
  Evaluate visible craftsmanship — skill, precision, and any innovative methods.

## Layer 3: Lighting Analysis
- What is the **primary source of light**, and how does it affect the mood and
  atmosphere?
- How does the **contrast** between bright and dark areas (high-key vs. low-key)
  influence the subject's appearance and the overall mood?
- What is the **direction and quality** of the light (hard/soft, natural/artificial,
  direct/diffused), and how does it influence texture and depth?
- How do **shadows and highlights** contribute to dimension, visual interest, and
  the viewer's attention?
- To what extent has the creator **intentionally shaped** the lighting to achieve
  a specific effect?

## Layer 4: Visual Composition & Design
Describe the image with enough precision that a graphic designer could recreate
it from your description alone.

- **Layout & spatial organization**: Where is every element positioned? Use clock
  positions, quadrants, or grid references. Describe foreground, midground,
  background.
- **Composition principles**: How are the rule of thirds, leading lines, framing,
  and balance/imbalance used? Where do they direct the viewer's eye?
- **Typography**: For any text, describe typeface style, weight, size relative to
  the image, color, and decorative treatments.
- **Graphic elements**: Borders, frames, ornamental devices, logos, symbols, icons,
  line work, patterns, and textures.
- **Figures & objects**: Describe every person, animal, object, and architectural
  element — their appearance, posture, clothing, expression, relative scale, and
  spatial relationships.
- **Style & period**: Identify the artistic or design style and approximate era.
- **Color palette**: List 5–10 key colors needed to reproduce this image.

## Layer 5: Text & Inscriptions — Complete Transcription
- Transcribe **ALL visible text** exactly as written, preserving spelling,
  capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks. Include text on edges, borders,
  stamps, watermarks, and film markings.
- Note the **location** of each text element within the image.
- Flag anything partially obscured or uncertain: [brackets] for best guesses,
  [???] for unreadable portions.
- Distinguish **handwriting vs. printed text** and describe handwriting
  characteristics.
- Note text in **languages other than English** and provide translations.
- For each text element, assess:
  - What information does it convey?
  - What is its tone (formal, informal, official, personal)?
  - How does it interact with the visual elements — does it add context, direct
    attention, or create meaning beyond the image alone?

## Layer 6: Content & Subject Matter — Deep Description
Examine every distinct element, figure, symbol, or object — **no matter how small**.

- **People**: Apparent age, gender presentation, ethnicity if discernible,
  clothing (era, formality, condition), accessories, posture, gesture, gaze
  direction, expression, identifying features, and relationships between figures.
- **Places**: Setting, architecture, landscape, vegetation, weather/lighting
  conditions, geographic clues.
- **Objects**: Type, material, condition, era, function, and any visible markings.
- **Symbols & iconography**: Identify and explain conventional meanings.
- **What is absent**: What might you expect to see that is missing? What has been
  deliberately excluded or is notable by its absence?

## Layer 7: Context, Provenance & Historical Reasoning
- **Date estimation**: Estimate the date or range. What evidence supports this?
  (Clothing, technology, printing methods, photographic process, design conventions,
  text dates, film markings.)
- **Geographic origin**: What clues point to a specific location?
- **Original context**: What was the probable original purpose, setting, or use?
- **Intended audience**: Who was this made for?
- **Historical connections**: Does this connect to known events, movements,
  traditions, or cultural practices?
- **Artistic lineage**: What style or movement does this belong to? What
  influences or comparisons to other works are evident? What makes this
  distinctive?
- **Creator's intent**: What messages, themes, or arguments was the creator
  making? How does their apparent background or perspective shape the work?
- **Authenticity**: To what extent does this present a genuine or contrived
  representation of reality?

## Layer 8: Interpretive Analysis & Genealogical Significance
- What **story** does this image tell? What narrative is it making?
- What **cultural, social, or historical values** does it reflect or challenge?
- What **emotions** was this image designed to evoke? How does form (design
  choices) reinforce or complicate content (subject matter)?
- **Personal and universal resonance**: What responses might this image evoke
  across different audiences, cultures, or time periods?
- **Genealogical research value**: What clues might help identify the people,
  places, or time period? What records, collections, or archives might this
  lead to? What research questions does it raise?

## Layer 9: Report & Conclusion

### 9a. Narrative Interpretation (~500–1000 words)
Synthesize your analysis into a vivid, engaging narrative — as if describing the
image to someone who cannot see it. Integrate findings from all layers. Provide
an appropriate title.

### 9b. Concise Summary (~100 words)
Distill the narrative to its essence. Highlight key aspects and insights.

### 9c. Final Conclusion
- Summarize your determinations about **date, location, and identity**.
  Be as specific as possible, citing evidence from the analysis.
- State the image's **significance** within its cultural, historical, or
  genealogical context.
- Identify the most important **unanswered questions**.

## Final Quality Gate

### The Recreation Test
Review everything above. Is the description complete enough that a skilled graphic
designer, working only from your text, could produce a faithful recreation of this
image? If not, add whatever is missing now.

### Uncertainty Discipline
- Flag anything you are uncertain about — **do not guess silently**.
- Distinguish between what the image shows and what you are inferring.
- Identify what additional information or research might resolve uncertainties.

### Suggested Next Steps
- Recommend related searches, records, archives, or resources that could deepen
  understanding of this image.
- Suggest specific follow-up analyses (e.g., compare with other images, consult
  specific databases, seek expert review in a particular domain).
