# Genealogical Writing Evaluation Rubric

A framework for evaluating published genealogical writing against professional standards. Derived from GPS methodology but adapted for narrative contexts where formal apparatus yields to readability.

## Purpose

This rubric evaluates **published genealogical writing** (blog posts, articles, family histories, compiled genealogies) rather than research outputs or proof arguments. It asks: *Does this writing demonstrate GPS-informed thinking while serving its audience effectively?*

## Scoring

Each criterion: **1** (Absent) | **2** (Weak) | **3** (Adequate) | **4** (Strong) | **5** (Exemplary)

---

## Layer 1: Evidentiary Foundation (GPS-Derived)

These criteria reflect whether the writing demonstrates sound genealogical methodology, even when formal GPS apparatus is not displayed.

### 1.1 Source Transparency (0-5)

**Question**: Can readers trace claims to their origins?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Every substantive claim attributed to specific source; readers can verify independently |
| 4 | Most claims attributed; occasional unsourced statements minor or contextual |
| 3 | Key facts sourced; some genealogically significant claims unsupported |
| 2 | Sporadic attribution; pattern of unsourced claims |
| 1 | No attribution; sources not identifiable |

**What to look for**:
- Are sources named, even informally? ("According to his death certificate..." / "The 1850 census shows...")
- Can readers locate the original if motivated?
- Are digital sources distinguished from originals when relevant?

### 1.2 Evidence Quality Awareness (0-5)

**Question**: Does the author demonstrate understanding that not all sources are equal?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Explicit evaluation of source reliability; distinguishes informant knowledge levels |
| 4 | Implicit awareness shown through qualifying language and source selection |
| 3 | Some recognition of source limitations; occasional uncritical acceptance |
| 2 | Treats all sources as equivalent; no quality differentiation |
| 1 | Relies on weak sources without acknowledgment; presents hearsay as fact |

**What to look for**:
- Does the author note when information comes from someone with firsthand knowledge vs. hearsay?
- Are family stories presented differently than vital records?
- Is there awareness that derivative sources may contain errors?

### 1.3 Epistemic Honesty (0-5)

**Question**: Does the author distinguish what is known from what is inferred or uncertain?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Clear separation of documented facts, reasonable inferences, and speculation; uncertainties flagged |
| 4 | Generally distinguishes certainty levels; occasional blurring |
| 3 | Some hedging language but inconsistent; mixes fact and inference |
| 2 | Presents inferences as established facts; minimal uncertainty acknowledgment |
| 1 | No distinction between proved and assumed; false certainty throughout |

**What to look for**:
- Language markers: "probably," "likely," "suggests," "we don't know" vs. unqualified assertions
- Are gaps acknowledged rather than papered over?
- When speculating, is it labeled as such?

### 1.4 Conflict Handling (0-5)

**Question**: When sources disagree, does the author address contradictions?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Contradictions explicitly identified; resolution explained with reasoning |
| 4 | Major conflicts addressed; minor discrepancies noted or explained |
| 3 | Some conflicts acknowledged; others ignored or glossed |
| 2 | Conflicts exist but unacknowledged; author cherry-picks convenient evidence |
| 1 | Contradictory information presented without recognition of conflict |

**What to look for**:
- Does the author acknowledge when birth dates vary across records?
- Are discrepancies explained (transcription error, age rounding, multiple informants)?
- Is there reasoning for preferring one source over another?

### 1.5 Research Scope Indication (0-5)

**Question**: Does the author convey the extent and limits of research conducted?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Clear indication of sources consulted; limitations and gaps explicitly stated |
| 4 | Research scope generally clear; some limitations noted |
| 3 | Implicit scope through sources cited; limitations not discussed |
| 2 | Unclear what was searched; no acknowledgment of potential gaps |
| 1 | Presents incomplete research as definitive; no scope awareness |

**What to look for**:
- Does the author mention what repositories or records were checked?
- Are research dead-ends or inaccessible records noted?
- Is there awareness that more sources may exist?

## Layer 2: Writing Quality (Narrative-Specific)

These criteria evaluate the writing as communication, independent of genealogical rigor.

### 2.1 Narrative Clarity (0-5)

**Question**: Is the writing clear, organized, and easy to follow?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Compelling narrative flow; complex information made accessible; excellent structure |
| 4 | Clear organization; easy to follow; minor rough patches |
| 3 | Generally understandable; some confusing passages or organizational issues |
| 2 | Difficult to follow; unclear structure; reader must work hard |
| 1 | Incoherent; disorganized; information scattered without logic |

**What to look for**:
- Is there a clear through-line or organizing principle?
- Can readers unfamiliar with the family follow the narrative?
- Are transitions between topics smooth?

### 2.2 Audience Calibration (0-5)

**Question**: Is the depth and style appropriate for the intended readers?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Perfectly pitched for audience; technical terms explained when needed; engaging throughout |
| 4 | Generally appropriate; occasional mismatch in assumed knowledge |
| 3 | Inconsistent calibration; parts too technical or too basic |
| 2 | Significant mismatch; assumes too much or too little of readers |
| 1 | Inappropriate for any identifiable audience |

**What to look for**:
- Is jargon defined or avoided for general audiences?
- For specialist audiences, is appropriate depth provided?
- Does the writing respect readers' time and intelligence?

### 2.3 Context Provision (0-5)

**Question**: Does the author provide sufficient historical and geographic context?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Rich contextual framing; ancestors placed in historical moment; helps readers understand era |
| 4 | Good context for major events; some assumptions about reader knowledge |
| 3 | Basic context provided; some events unexplained |
| 2 | Minimal context; assumes familiarity with time/place |
| 1 | No context; isolated facts without historical grounding |

**What to look for**:
- Are unfamiliar historical events explained?
- Is geographic context clear (where places are, what jurisdictions applied)?
- Does the reader understand *why* ancestors made choices?

### 2.4 Engagement Value (0-5)

**Question**: Does the writing hold reader interest?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Compelling storytelling; makes readers care about subjects; memorable |
| 4 | Engaging throughout; maintains interest; some standout moments |
| 3 | Readable but not gripping; informational more than engaging |
| 2 | Dry or tedious; reader motivation required to continue |
| 1 | Unreadable; fails to engage on any level |

**What to look for**:
- Does the author bring ancestors to life as people?
- Are anecdotes, details, or insights included that reward reading?
- Would non-family members find this interesting?

| 2 | Difficult to verify; citations incomplete or informal |
| 1 | Unverifiable; no path to original sources |

### 3.2 Research Leads (0-5)

**Question**: Does the writing suggest avenues for further research?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Explicit research suggestions; identifies gaps; names specific sources to pursue |
| 4 | Clear leads for interested researchers; some gaps identified |
| 3 | Implicit leads through context; researcher must identify gaps |
| 2 | Few leads; dead-end presentation |
| 1 | No research utility; closes rather than opens inquiry |

### 3.3 Contribution to Knowledge (0-5)

**Question**: Does this writing add something new to the genealogical record?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Significant new findings; original analysis; advances understanding |
| 4 | Solid contribution; synthesizes or clarifies existing knowledge |
| 3 | Modest contribution; shares personal research publicly |
| 2 | Largely derivative; minimal new information |

| 40-49 | **Strong**: Solid genealogical writing with minor gaps |
| 30-39 | **Adequate**: Serviceable but with significant room for improvement |
| 20-29 | **Weak**: Fundamental issues with evidence, clarity, or utility |
| Below 20 | **Poor**: Does not meet basic standards for genealogical writing |

## Usage Notes

### Genre Calibration
Different genres have different expectations:
- **Blog posts**: Lower bar for formal apparatus; higher bar for engagement
- **Journal articles**: High bar for evidentiary standards; lower bar for narrative flair
- **Family histories**: Balance required; audience often mixed experience levels
- **Compiled genealogies**: Evidence standards paramount; narrative optional

### What This Rubric Does NOT Measure
- Accuracy of conclusions (requires independent verification)
- Exhaustiveness of research (only scope indication)
- Citation format correctness (only whether sources are identifiable)
- Writing style preferences (only clarity and accessibility)

### Relationship to GPS
This rubric asks whether writing *reflects* GPS-informed thinking, not whether it *displays* GPS apparatus. A blog post can score highly without using terms like "derivative source" or "indirect evidence"—if the underlying reasoning demonstrates those principles.
