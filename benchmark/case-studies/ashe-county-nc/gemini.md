**History of the Settlement of Ashe County, North Carolina (1492–1799)**

### **I. Geographic Context: The "Lost Province"**

To understand the settlement of Ashe County, one must first understand the formidable geography that dictated its isolation. Located in the extreme northwestern corner of North Carolina, the area that became Ashe County sits atop a rolling plateau within the Blue Ridge Mountains, ranging generally from 2,500 to 3,000 feet in elevation, with peaks such as Mount Jefferson rising significantly higher [1][2].

The defining feature of this landscape is the New River. Geologically considered one of the oldest rivers in the world, the New River defies the standard drainage patterns of the region. Unlike most North Carolina rivers that flow southeast toward the Atlantic, the New River flows *north*—cutting through the plateau into Virginia and eventually West Virginia to join the Kanawha and Ohio systems [1][3].

For early European settlers moving inland from the Atlantic coast, the Eastern Continental Divide (the crest of the Blue Ridge) presented a massive physical wall. The area remained inaccessible from the east for decades after the Piedmont was settled. Consequently, the region’s eventual settlement did not come primarily from the North Carolina east, but rather via the Great Wagon Road from Pennsylvania and down through the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. This north-to-south migration route, followed by a push upstream (southward) along the New River, created a population distinct from the lowland aristocracy of eastern North Carolina. Due to this mountain barrier, Ashe County—along with Alleghany and Watauga—would later be historically dubbed the "Lost Provinces," a term reflecting their disconnection from the rest of the state [1][5].

### **II. Indigenous History (Pre-1750)**

#### **The "Middle Ground" and Hunting Territories**

Before European entry, the New River Valley was not an empty wilderness, though its precise habitation status in the 17th century is a subject of historical synthesis rather than abundant primary documentation. By the time of European contact in the wider region, the high plateau served primarily as a "Middle Ground" or buffer zone between powerful indigenous nations: the **Cherokee** to the south and west, the **Shawnee** to the north (Ohio Valley), and Siouan-speaking groups like the **Catawba** to the southeast [2][5].

While popular lore often claims the mountains were solely hunting grounds and never permanently inhabited, archaeological evidence suggests otherwise. Paleo-Indian presence dates back to 12,000 BC, and Woodland period sites (500 BC–1000 AD) indicate the valley was a significant food-gathering corridor [5]. However, by the mid-18th century, the region was indeed largely utilized for seasonal hunting and warfare rather than permanent towns, likely due to the cooling climate of the Little Ice Age and the pressures of the Beaver Wars, which depopulated parts of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.

#### **Direct Evidence of Indigenous Presence**

Primary information regarding indigenous presence comes from the first recorded European survey. In 1752, Moravian Bishop **Augustus Gottlieb Spangenberg** recorded seeing "Indian Old Fields"—areas of land that had been previously cleared and cultivated by Native Americans but were currently abandoned. Spangenberg noted in his diary that the land was "much frequented by the Catawbas and Cherokees, especially for hunting," and observed the remnants of an "Indian fort" [4]. This direct evidence confirms that while the European settlers found the land "vacant" of active towns, it was a managed and contested landscape integral to indigenous economies.

### **III. Exploration and Early Surveys (1740s–1760s)**

#### **The Spangenberg Survey (1752)**

The first reliable recorded exploration of the area was the Moravian survey of 1752. Bishop Spangenberg, seeking 100,000 acres to establish a Moravian colony (which would eventually become the Wachovia tract in present-day Forsyth County), crossed the Blue Ridge and entered the New River watershed.

His diary entries portray a brutal wilderness. In December 1752, his party became hopelessly lost in the tangle of mountains. Spangenberg wrote of the New River: *"The river ran now north, now south, now east, now west, in short to all points of the compass!"* [3]. Although Spangenberg ultimately rejected the area for the main Moravian settlement due to its ruggedness and isolation, his journals provide the earliest written baseline for the county's ecology, noting the fertile soil in the river bottoms and the potential for water power.

#### **The Long Hunters (1760s)**

Following Spangenberg, the next wave of Europeans were "Long Hunters"—men who spent months or years in the wilderness harvesting deerskins for export. The most famous of these, **Daniel Boone**, is confirmed to have hunted in the region during the 1760s. Boone’s trail and temporary camps likely dotted the area, as his family lived nearby in the Yadkin Valley before his push into Kentucky. These hunters utilized the "Indian Old Fields" for camping and grazing horses, inadvertently preparing the intelligence required for permanent settlement [2].

### **IV. Permanent Settlement (1770–1780)**

#### **The First Settlers Controversy**

Identifying the "first" permanent settler is often a matter of local tradition, but historical consensus points to the early 1770s. Three names appear consistently in early records: **David Helton**, **William Walling**, and **William McLain** (or McLane).

* **Direct Evidence:** Secondary historical synthesis asserts that these three men came from Virginia on a hunting expedition in 1770 and returned to build cabins in **1771** near Helton Creek (a tributary of the New River) [2][4].
* **Legal Context:** It is important to note that in 1771, this settlement was technically illegal or at least extralegal. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 officially forbade settlement west of the Continental Divide to reserve the land for Native Americans. However, enforcement in this remote cove was nonexistent.

#### **Captain John Cox**

Another pivotal figure was **Captain John Cox**. Tradition holds that Cox may have been present as early as the 1740s, but reliable evidence places his permanent settlement later. Cox became a substantial landowner and a militia leader during the Revolutionary War. His fortified home served as a rally point for the scattered frontier families [5].

#### **Life on the Frontier**

The settlers of the 1770s practiced subsistence agriculture. They raised corn, rye, and livestock—particularly cattle and hogs, which could be branded and turned loose to forage in the woods (open range). The isolation meant that almost every manufactured good had to be produced locally or packed in over dangerous trails. Iron was discovered early, and small-scale mining and smelting began to appear, foreshadowing the area's later iron industry [5].

### **V. The Revolutionary War Era (1776–1783)**

The Revolutionary War in the Ashe County region was a vicious, irregular civil war between neighbors—Whigs (Patriots) and Tories (Loyalists)—rather than a conflict involving British Regulars.

#### **The Political Divide**

The remoteness of the region attracted those wishing to escape the conflict, as well as Loyalist partisans who used the mountains as a base to raid Patriot settlements in the Yadkin Valley. The area was nominally part of **Wilkes County** (formed 1777) during the war, meaning the local militia operated under the command of Colonel **Benjamin Cleveland** of Wilkes, a figure known as the "Terror of the Tories" [6][7].

#### **The Battle of the Big Glades (1781)**

The only significant military engagement within the modern boundaries of Ashe County was the **Battle of the Big Glades** (also associated with the "Old Fields" area).

* **Context:** In April 1781, Colonel Benjamin Cleveland was visiting his farm at the Old Fields (near the Ashe/Watauga border).
* **The Skirmish:** A Loyalist band led by **Captain William Riddle** ambushed and captured Cleveland. They transported him into the mountains (near a location later called Riddle’s Knob).
* **The Rescue:** Cleveland’s brother, Captain Robert Cleveland, rallied the Whig militia. They tracked Riddle’s party and launched a surprise attack at Wolf’s Den. The Whigs routed the Loyalists and rescued Colonel Cleveland.
* **Aftermath:** This event is documented in pension applications (such as that of Ishmael Titus) and local histories. It culminated in the execution of Captain Riddle and others at the "Tory Oak" in Wilkesboro, illustrating the brutal, personal nature of the war in the high country [6].

#### **The State of Franklin (1784–1788)**

Following the war, the settlers in the trans-montane region felt neglected by the North Carolina government. In 1784, settlers in present-day eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina formed the **State of Franklin**, an autonomous separatist government. For a brief period (roughly 1784–1789), the area of Ashe County was claimed by Franklin. However, the state was never recognized by the Continental Congress, and North Carolina eventually reasserted its jurisdiction [1][5].

### **VI. County Formation (1790s–1799)**

#### **Population Growth**

By the 1790s, the threat of indigenous raids had largely subsided due to the Cherokee defeats in the Chickamauga Wars. This stability led to a surge in migration. The 1790 Census (covering the area as part of Wilkes County) shows a growing population of families, not just hunters.

#### **The Act of 1799**

As the population west of the Blue Ridge increased, the trek to the county seat in Wilkesboro—requiring a journey down the precipitous mountain escarpment—became politically untenable.

* **Legislative Action:** In **1799**, the North Carolina General Assembly passed an act to divide Wilkes County. The text described the new county as comprising "that portion of Wilkes lying west of the extreme height of the Appalachian Mountains" [5][8].
* **Naming:** The new jurisdiction was named **Ashe County** in honor of **Samuel Ashe**, a Revolutionary patriot who was the sitting Governor of North Carolina (1795–1798) [2][8].
* **Scope:** At its creation in 1799, Ashe County was massive. It included the territory of present-day Ashe, Watauga (formed 1849), and Alleghany (formed 1859) counties. It effectively covered the entire northwest corner of the state.

#### **Establishing the Seat**

The act of formation required the selection of a county seat. A special commission was appointed to locate a "proper and convenient" place. They purchased 50 acres for $100—a high price that drew local criticism—to establish the town of **Jeffersonton** (later shortened to Jefferson). Chartered in roughly 1803 (just after the 1799 cutoff, but part of the formation process), it holds the distinction of being one of the first towns in the nation named for Thomas Jefferson, who was Vice President at the time of the county's inception [2][5].

### **VII. Summary of Settlement Dynamics**

| Period | Key Development | Information Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-1750** | Indigenous "Middle Ground"; seasonal hunting by Cherokee/Shawnee. | Secondary (Archaeology) |
| **1752** | Moravian Bishop Spangenberg surveys the area; notes "Indian Old Fields." | Primary (Diary) |
| **1760s** | Long Hunters (Boone, etc.) explore and map trails. | Secondary (Tradition) |
| **1771** | First permanent cabins (Helton, Walling) built illegally/extralegally. | Secondary (Synthesis) |
| **1781** | Battle of the Big Glades (Whig vs. Tory skirmish). | Primary (Pension Records) |
| **1784-88** | Region claimed by the separatist State of Franklin. | Primary (Legal History) |
| **1799** | Ashe County officially formed from Wilkes; named for Gov. Samuel Ashe. | Primary (NC Laws) |

By 1799, Ashe County had transitioned from a contested indigenous hunting ground to a frontier outpost, and finally to a legally recognized political entity. Its settlement was defined by the north-flowing New River, which oriented its early culture and economy toward Virginia and the Ohio Valley rather than the North Carolina Piedmont, a distinction that remains visible in the region's cultural geography today.
