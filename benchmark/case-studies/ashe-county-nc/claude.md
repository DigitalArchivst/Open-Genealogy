# The Settlement of Ashe County, North Carolina: Geography, Indigenous History, and European Colonization (1492–1799)

## Geography and Physical Setting

Ashe County occupies the extreme northwestern corner of North Carolina, bordered by two states: Virginia to the north and Tennessee to the west [1][2]. The county lies entirely within the Appalachian Mountains region, positioned atop a rolling plateau ranging from 2,500 to 3,000 feet above sea level, with five mountains rising above 5,000 feet [1]. Mount Jefferson, a State Natural Area towering 4,665 feet and prominently visible from the towns of Jefferson and West Jefferson, stands as a prominent landmark [1]. The southeastern boundary drops sharply to approximately 1,500 feet in neighboring Wilkes County [1].

The county's principal waterway, the New River, is among the oldest rivers in North America geologically—possibly between 10 million and 360 million years old—and one of the few major rivers in the southeastern United States flowing primarily northward rather than southward [1][3]. The river is formed by the confluence of its South Fork and North Fork along the Ashe-Alleghany County boundary before flowing into Virginia and eventually joining the Kanawha River system [3]. Despite its name—derived from its "discovery" in previously unmapped territory in 1749—the New River's ancient geological origins remain remarkable [3].

The Blue Ridge Parkway traverses approximately 30 miles through the county's scenic southeastern corner, connecting this highland region to the broader Appalachian chain stretching from Georgia to Pennsylvania [4]. The terrain historically isolated this region from the eastern parts of North Carolina, leading nineteenth- and early twentieth-century observers to characterize Ashe County as one of the "Lost Provinces" of the state [5].

## Indigenous Presence Before European Contact

The southern Appalachian highlands supported indigenous communities for millennia before European arrival. Archaeological evidence indicates human presence in the Cherokee homeland region—encompassing present-day western North Carolina—extending back approximately 12,000 years [6]. The Cherokee people, members of the Iroquoian language family, are descended from native peoples who occupied these mountains beginning approximately 8000 BCE [7]. By approximately 1500 BCE, a distinct Cherokee language had developed, and by 1000 CE, the Cherokee were living a Woodland lifestyle with cultural characteristics influenced by Mississippian religious traditions [7].

Within present-day Ashe County specifically, historical evidence indicates habitation by Native American peoples including the Cherokee, Creek, and Shawnee tribes [1][8]. Archaeological discoveries—pottery fragments, arrowheads, and other artifacts—attest to their presence, with most finds concentrated in the "Old Fields" area of Ashe County [1][8]. However, the nature of this presence remains somewhat uncertain. The region appears to have functioned primarily as hunting territory rather than as a location for permanent Cherokee towns, which were concentrated further south and west along river valleys in present-day southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, and neighboring areas [9][10].

Prior to the eighteenth century, Cherokee territorial homelands encompassed approximately 40,000 square miles in the southern Appalachian region, with an estimated population of 22,500 to 25,000 persons in 1650 [9][10]. Cherokee settlements were geographically classified by colonial-era Europeans into divisions based on their position relative to Atlantic coast settlements: the Lower Towns along the Keowee River headwaters in present-day South Carolina; the Middle Towns along the upper Little Tennessee and French Broad Rivers in present-day western North Carolina; the Valley Towns along the Hiwassee and Valley Rivers; and the Overhill Towns in present-day eastern Tennessee [9][10]. The area that became Ashe County lay north of these principal settlement zones but within the broader Cherokee sphere of influence and use.

The earliest recorded European contact with the Cherokee occurred during Hernando de Soto's 1540–41 expedition through the southeastern interior, when Spanish forces traversed through present-day South Carolina into western North Carolina and Cherokee territory [9]. The Spanish documented encountering Mississippian-era peoples ancestral to historic Southeastern tribes, though sustained European-Cherokee relations would not develop until the late seventeenth century [9][7].

## Early European Exploration and the Colonial Period

The territory that would become Ashe County passed through several administrative jurisdictions during the colonial era. Initially part of the vast Albemarle County—one of three precincts created by the Lords Proprietors following King Charles II's 1663 grant of Carolina—the area subsequently became part of Anson County, then Rowan County in 1753, Surry County in 1771, and Wilkes County in 1777 [8][11].

The first documented European exploration specifically visiting present-day Ashe County occurred in 1749, when Peter Jefferson—father of future President Thomas Jefferson—led a surveying party to establish the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, as early visitors were uncertain in which colony they stood [8][12]. Three years later, in September 1752, Bishop Augustus Gottlieb Spangenberg, head of the Moravian Church in America, led an expedition from Pennsylvania through North Carolina seeking 100,000 acres of land suitable for Moravian settlement [13][14][15].

Spangenberg's party departed Edenton on September 10, 1752, and traversed much of the North Carolina backcountry over the following months [13][14]. By early December, the expedition entered the western mountains, where Spangenberg recorded challenging winter conditions in his diary: experiencing winds he described as among the coldest he had ever felt, with snow-covered ground and water freezing by the fire [8]. Despite these hardships, Spangenberg concluded the land was suitable for agriculture and cattle raising [8]. The party ultimately selected land further east in the Yadkin Valley—present-day Forsyth County—which became the Wachovia tract, surveyed between December 27, 1752, and January 13, 1753 [15][16]. Of Spangenberg's original party members, only Herman Loesch later returned to settle permanently in the Ashe County area [1][8].

## Settlement and the Revolutionary Era

Permanent European-American settlement in the Ashe region began in earnest during the 1770s. The county's earliest recorded deed dates to 1773 [8][12]. References to hunting expeditions in the area date to this period, with David Helton counted among the earliest hunters and Daniel Boone—who lived in North Carolina from approximately 1752 to 1773 and regularly hunted throughout the Blue Ridge highlands—being the most recognizable [8][17][18]. Boone spent most of his time in the northern Carolina piedmont and high country, including the Yadkin River valley upstream to the Blue Ridge Plateau, and he made frequent excursions into the mountains during the late 1760s and early 1770s [17][18].

The region's colonial-era development was shaped by the broader conflict between expanding European-American settlement and Cherokee territorial claims. King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, attempting to protect Cherokee and other tribal lands from colonial encroachment, but enforcement proved difficult [9]. From 1769 to 1772, settlers from Virginia and North Carolina squatted on Cherokee lands in the Tennessee region, forming the Watauga Association—among the first autonomous European-American governing bodies west of the Appalachian Mountains [19][20].

The American Revolution intensified Cherokee-settler conflicts. The Cherokee, allied with the British in hopes that a crown victory would protect their remaining lands, launched attacks on frontier settlements in 1776 [9][10]. Overmountain settlers, including Wataugans and other mountain communities, responded forcefully. In October 1780, frontier militias, including forces from the Watauga settlements, achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of King's Mountain [19][20]. This engagement helped turn the tide of the southern campaign and demonstrated the military capability of trans-Appalachian settlers.

## The State of Franklin and the Path to County Formation

Perhaps the most significant political episode in the pre-county history of the Ashe region was its inclusion within the short-lived State of Franklin. On August 23, 1784, delegates from four western North Carolina counties—Washington, Sullivan, Spencer, and Greene (all now in Tennessee)—declared independence from North Carolina in response to the state legislature's cession of its western lands to the federal government [20][21][22]. Under the leadership of John Sevier, these mountain settlers established their own government, with Jonesborough serving as the capital [20][21].

The lands of present-day Ashe, Alleghany, and Watauga counties were considered part of the abortive state during this period [23]. Franklin operated as a functioning parallel government for approximately four and a half years, issuing land grants, granting marriage licenses, building roads, and even negotiating treaties with the Cherokee [20][21][22]. However, the state was never admitted to the Union, and its lack of congressional recognition proved fatal. Continued Cherokee attacks, combined with economic weakness and internal divisions—particularly the rivalry between Sevier and loyalist John Tipton—led to Franklin's collapse by 1788–1789 [20][21][22].

Following Franklin's dissolution, the territory was claimed as part of Washington County within the Southwest Territory (later Tennessee) until North Carolina annexed the lands back into Wilkes County in 1792 [23]. Violent disputes with Cherokee and other indigenous groups during this period led settlers to seek protection from the North Carolina state militia, accelerating demands for local government [2].

## Formation of Ashe County in 1799

Ashe County was officially established by act of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1799. The enabling legislation was remarkably brief, simply stating that "all of that part of the County of Wilkes, lying west of the extreme height of the Appalachian Mountains, shall be and the same is hereby erected into a separate and distinct county by the name of Ashe" [11][24]. The county was named to honor Samuel Ashe, who served as Governor of North Carolina from 1795 to 1798 and had previously distinguished himself as a Revolutionary War patriot and Superior Court judge [2][8][11].

The county seat, Jefferson, was established in 1803 and named for President Thomas Jefferson—becoming one of the first places in America to bear his name [2][8]. A survey team consisting of General Joseph McDowell, Colonel David Vance, and Major Mussendine Matthews began marking boundaries in May 1799, starting on Pond Mountain and initially spending time with Captain Isaac Weaver in northwestern Ashe County [24]. The border between North Carolina and Tennessee remained incompletely established at the time, creating some jurisdictional uncertainty that would require later resolution [24].

## Conflicts, Uncertainties, and Methodological Notes

Several aspects of this history require qualification. First, the nature of indigenous use of the specific Ashe County territory remains imperfectly documented. Archaeological evidence confirms Native American presence, but whether this represented seasonal hunting activity, permanent settlement, or contested borderland territory among multiple groups (Cherokee, Creek, Shawnee) cannot be definitively established from current accessible sources [1][8]. The characterization of pre-colonial indigenous history relies substantially on secondary synthesis and authored narratives rather than primary archaeological documentation.

Second, claims that the New River is definitively the "second-oldest river in the world" are disputed by geological authorities including the West Virginia Geological and Economic Survey and the National Park Service [25]. While the river's great antiquity is not in question, precise ranking claims should be approached with appropriate skepticism.

Third, some chronological details—such as the precise date of first European-American settlement within present-day Ashe County boundaries—vary across sources. The 1773 deed date and 1770s hunting expedition references represent the earliest documented activities but may not capture earlier unrecorded presence [8][12].
