# GPT Configurations

Configuration files for Custom GPT deployments on the OpenAI platform.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [open-geneagpt-v0.4.txt](open-geneagpt-v0.4.txt) | Full Custom GPT specification for "Open GeneaGPT" — identity, personality, seven core duties, and operational guidelines |
| [website-frontend-v3.txt](website-frontend-v3.txt) | Domain-fronted GPT configuration for website integration |

## Why `.txt`?

These files use `.txt` format because the OpenAI Custom GPT interface expects plain text for system instructions. All other prompts in this repository use `.md`.

## Platform Scope

These configs are specific to OpenAI's Custom GPT platform. The prompts in other folders (research/, transcription/, writing-tools/, etc.) work across any LLM — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others. See the [Getting Started guide](../GETTING-STARTED.md) for general usage instructions.
