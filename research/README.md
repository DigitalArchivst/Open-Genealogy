# GPS Research Methodology

Prompts for **Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)** compliant research workflows. These encode professional methodology developed by the Board for Certification of Genealogists and documented in Mills' *Evidence Explained*.

## Core Concepts

GPS ensures genealogical conclusions are well-reasoned and evidence-based through five interdependent elements:

1. **Reasonably exhaustive research**
2. **Complete, accurate citations**
3. **Thorough analysis and correlation**
4. **Resolution of conflicting evidence**
5. **Coherent written conclusion**

## Recommended Prompts

| Prompt | Purpose | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **[research-assistant-v6.1.md](research-assistant-v6.1.md)** | Full GPS-compliant research assistant | System prompt for ongoing research assistance |
| **[research-assistant-v6.1-compressed.md](research-assistant-v6.1-compressed.md)** | Token-efficient version | Context-limited models |
| **[research-with-citations-v7.md](research-with-citations-v7.md)** | Web research with GPS methodology | Single research queries with citation requirements |
| **[contract-first-genealogy-v3.1.md](contract-first-genealogy-v3.1.md)** | Contract-lock workflow | Structured research projects with deliverables |
| **[research-agent-assignment-v2.1.md](research-agent-assignment-v2.1.md)** | Research agent specification | Autonomous research tasks |

## Evidence Analysis Framework

The prompts use the **Evidence Analysis Process Map** vocabulary:

| Element | Classes | Definition |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **SOURCES** | Original, Derivative, Authored | The containers holding information |
| **INFORMATION** | Primary, Secondary, Indeterminate | Content classified by informant's knowledge |
| **EVIDENCE** | Direct, Indirect, Negative | Interpretation relative to research question |

See [reference/evidence-terminology.md](reference/evidence-terminology.md) for detailed definitions.
