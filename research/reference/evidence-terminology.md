## The Evidence Analysis Process Map

The Evidence Analysis Process Map is a structured framework for evaluating genealogical findings, developed by Elizabeth Shown Mills and codified in professional standards by the Board for Certification of Genealogists. It operationalizes the mantra: **"Sources give us information, from which we identify evidence. All undergo the evaluation process to produce proof."** [1]

### Framework Structure: The "3x3"

The current version comprises three analytical elements, each with three classes [1][2]:

| Element | Classes | Definition |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **SOURCES** | Original · Derivative · Authored | The physical or digital containers holding information |
| **INFORMATION** | Primary · Secondary · Indeterminate | The content within sources, classified by informant's knowledge |
| **EVIDENCE** | Direct · Indirect · Negative | Our interpretation of information relative to a specific research question |

### Evolution of the Framework

The Evidence Analysis Process Map underwent significant revision between 2012–2013:

**Version 1 (2007–2012)**: Presented in early editions of *Evidence Explained*, this version used a "2x2" structure—two classes for each of the three analytical elements. [1]

**Version 2 (2013–present)**: Expanded to the "3x3" to address persistent ambiguities. The third category was added to each element: [2]
- **Authored works** (for sources)—distinguishing compiled narratives from mere copies
- **Indeterminate** (for information)—acknowledging when we cannot identify the informant
- **Negative evidence** (for evidence)—formalizing the analytical value of expected information's absence

This revision emerged from collaborative discussion among leading practitioners and was formally unveiled at the NGS 2013 Conference. [2]

### Key Definitions

**Sources** [1][3]:
- **Original**: First recording, created at or near the event (minister's register, courthouse record)
- **Derivative**: Copy, transcription, extraction, or abstract of an original
- **Authored**: Narrative work created from other sources (compiled genealogy, biography)

**Information** [1][3]:
- **Primary**: Provided by someone with firsthand knowledge of the event
- **Secondary**: Provided by someone reporting what they heard (hearsay)
- **Indeterminate**: Informant unknown or their relationship to event unclear

**Evidence** [1][4]:
- **Direct**: Explicitly addresses the research question
- **Indirect**: Implies an answer through inference when combined with other evidence
- **Negative**: The absence of expected information in a source likely to contain it—what Mills calls "contextually suggestive silence" [5]

### Analytical Process

Mills emphasizes that evidence classification depends entirely on the research question being asked. The same document can provide different evidence types for different questions. [4]

The framework integrates with the **Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)**, which requires: [3][6]
1. Reasonably exhaustive research
2. Complete, accurate citations
3. Thorough analysis and correlation of sources, information, and evidence
4. Resolution of conflicting evidence
5. A soundly reasoned, coherently written conclusion

### Practical Application

Mills compares using this framework to using grammar: once internalized, you don't consciously label every element, but your success depends on understanding the structure. [1] The framework appears on the flyleaf of *Evidence Explained* and in BCG's *Genealogy Standards*. [3][6]

**Note on currency**: The 3x3 framework has been stable since 2013. *Genealogy Standards* was revised in 2021 with updated DNA and privacy standards but retained the core evidence analysis structure. *Evidence Explained* 4th edition was published in 2024.
