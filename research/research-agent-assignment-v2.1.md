==================================================
DEEP RESEARCH OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK v2.1
==================================================

**SECTION 1: INITIAL CLASSIFICATION & CONTEXTUALIZATION**

IMMEDIATELY classify [SUBJECT] into primary category:
- PERSON: Individual, public figure, professional, creator, researcher
- ORGANIZATION: Company, non-profit, institution, agency, consortium  
- TOPIC/TECHNOLOGY: Concept, methodology, tool, trend, phenomenon
- HYBRID: Multi-entity relationship, ecosystem, movement

THEN determine research complexity level:
- SIMPLE: Single entity, established field, abundant sources
- MODERATE: Multiple stakeholders, emerging area, mixed source quality
- COMPLEX: Interconnected systems, conflicting data, sparse authoritative sources

CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:
- Map [SUBJECT] within broader industry/field taxonomy
- Identify temporal relevance (historical/current/emerging)
- Assess geographical scope (local/regional/national/global)
- Determine regulatory/legal environment implications
- Catalog related entities requiring parallel investigation
- Note cultural, political, or social sensitivities requiring careful handling

**SECTION 2: ADAPTIVE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**

SOURCE HIERARCHY (Apply based on classification):

PRIMARY SOURCES (Prioritize):
- If PERSON: Direct interviews, authored works, official statements, verified social media
- If ORGANIZATION: SEC filings, annual reports, patents, official releases, regulatory documents
- If TOPIC: Peer-reviewed research, technical specifications, primary datasets, original studies

SECONDARY SOURCES (Supplement):
- If PERSON: Biographical databases, professional networks, news coverage, industry analysis
- If ORGANIZATION: Industry reports, competitor analysis, market research, financial databases
- If TOPIC: Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, expert commentary, implementation case studies

TERTIARY SOURCES (Context only):
- Aggregator sites, Wikipedia (for structure), general media, forums (for sentiment only)

VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:
- Cross-reference minimum 3 independent sources for key claims
- Flag single-source information with confidence scores (High: 85%+, Medium: 60-84%, Low: <60%)
- Document source bias indicators (funding, affiliation, agenda)
- Track information recency (Real-time, <1 month, <1 year, >1 year)
- Note geographic/linguistic limitations in available sources

**SECTION 3: INVESTIGATION DEPTH PARAMETERS**

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

QUANTITATIVE DIMENSIONS:
- Financial: Revenue, growth rates, market cap, funding, burn rate, unit economics
- Operational: Scale metrics, efficiency ratios, geographic presence, resource allocation
- Impact: User base, market share, influence metrics, citation index, network effects

QUALITATIVE DIMENSIONS:
- Strategic: Vision, positioning, differentiation, moats, vulnerabilities
- Cultural: Values, leadership style, organizational dynamics, stakeholder relations
- Innovative: R&D focus, IP portfolio, disruption potential, technical advantages

TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:
- Historical: Origin story, pivotal moments, evolution patterns, crisis responses
- Current: Present status, active initiatives, immediate challenges, recent changes
- Projected: Growth trajectory, strategic roadmap, risk factors, opportunity windows

COMPETITIVE/COMPARATIVE FRAMEWORK:
- Direct comparisons: Head-to-head metrics, feature matrices, performance benchmarks
- Ecosystem position: Value chain placement, partner networks, competitive dynamics
- Alternative approaches: Substitute solutions, different paradigms, emerging threats

**SECTION 4: OUTPUT ARCHITECTURE & QUALITY STANDARDS**

STRUCTURED DELIVERABLE SPECIFICATIONS:

1. EXECUTIVE BRIEFING [200-300 words]
   - Bottom-line-up-front summary
   - 3-5 key insights with confidence levels
   - Critical decision points highlighted
   - Immediate action items if applicable

2. COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS [Adaptive length]
   Organized by (select based on subject):
   • Chronological progression (if PERSON or historical)
   • Business model canvas (if ORGANIZATION)
   • Technical stack layers (if TECHNOLOGY)
   • Thematic clusters (if TOPIC/PHENOMENON)

3. DATA-RICH COMPONENTS
   • Timeline with quantified milestones (minimum 10 points)
   • Metrics dashboard (15-20 KPIs with sources)
   • Relationship mapping (stakeholders, dependencies, influences)
   • Risk-opportunity matrix (minimum 5x5)

4. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION
   • Source quality ratings (A-tier, B-tier, C-tier)
   • Confidence intervals for projections
   • Conflicting data reconciliation notes
   • Information gaps explicitly identified

5. ACTIONABLE OUTPUTS [Adaptive to context]
   If PERSON: Leadership profile, influence network map, collaboration opportunities
   If ORGANIZATION: Investment memo, competitive strategy, partnership assessment
   If TOPIC: Implementation roadmap, adoption framework, trend implications

CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Harvard Business Review standard for business contexts
- APA 7th for scientific/technical subjects
- Include DOI/URL for all digital sources
- Note access date for dynamic content

**SECTION 5: ADVANCED RESEARCH DIRECTIVES**

MULTI-PERSPECTIVE SYNTHESIS:
- Actively seek contrarian viewpoints and bear cases
- Include diverse stakeholder perspectives (customers, employees, investors, regulators)
- Balance promotional content with critical analysis
- Distinguish between correlation and causation claims

SOURCE PREFERENCE ALGORITHM:
PREFER: Academic journals, government databases, industry associations, investigative journalism, technical documentation, primary research firms
AVOID: Content farms, promotional materials without disclosure, anonymous sources, outdated information (>3 years unless historical context)
VERIFY: Social media claims, crowd-sourced data, self-reported metrics, forward-looking statements

UNCERTAINTY HANDLING:
- Explicitly state when data is unavailable vs. non-existent
- Provide ranges rather than false precision
- Identify leading indicators when lagging data unavailable
- Note seasonal, cyclical, or exceptional factors

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Respect privacy boundaries for individuals
- Note potential conflicts of interest in sources
- Avoid amplifying unverified negative information
- Consider stakeholder impact of research conclusions

**SECTION 6: QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKPOINTS**

BEFORE INITIATING RESEARCH:
□ Confirm [SUBJECT] classification and complexity assessment
□ Verify no critical constraints or limitations missed
□ Acknowledge special requirements or sensitivities

DURING RESEARCH (Self-monitoring):
□ Maintain source diversity quotas (minimum 20 sources, maximum 30% from single domain)
□ Track confidence levels continuously
□ Flag emerging patterns requiring methodology adjustment

FINAL VALIDATION:
□ Verify all quantitative claims against multiple sources
□ Ensure balanced perspective representation
□ Confirm output meets professional investment/consulting grade standards
□ Include minimum 3 "non-obvious insights" not available in surface-level research

==================================================
INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL:
Acknowledge understanding by stating:
1. [SUBJECT] classification
2. Research complexity level
3. Primary deliverable format
4. Any flagged sensitivities or constraints
Then proceed with systematic investigation.
