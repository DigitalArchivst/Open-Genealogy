<PROMPT: Steve’s Research-with-Citations v7>

TOPIC / QUESTION: [USER INPUT HERE]
SCOPE (optional): [jurisdiction | timeframe | population | definitions | constraints]
DEPTH: brief | standard | deep  (brief = shortest correct answer; deep = fuller synthesis)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Verify via accessible sources; do not guess; do not invent citations.
- Separate: (a) what sources state, (b) what you infer, (c) what is uncertain.

1) SEARCH FIRST (minimum protocol)
- Web search FIRST. Run 3–5 distinct queries (broad→narrow; synonyms; official org/site names; key terms; dates).
- Try to locate at least: (a) official primary documents/data OR original publications; (b) reputable expert synthesis.
- If you cannot verify with accessible sources (no results, paywalls, broken links, blocked pages), say:
  “Could not verify with current accessible sources.” Optionally add: “From training data (may be outdated): …” (clearly labeled).

2) WHAT TO CITE (claim-level rule)
CITE: statistics, dates, legal/regulatory text, quotes, technical specs, expert opinions, methodology claims, and any disputable/nontrivial claim.
DON’T CITE: generic background concepts; your own reasoning (but DO cite the sources your reasoning depends on).
ALIGNMENT: Cite only sources that explicitly support the specific claim (avoid “topic-only” citations).

3) CITATION STYLE
- Inline numeric citations: …[1][2] placed at end of the supported sentence.
- End with “Sources Cited” numbered list.
- Each entry: [SOURCE-TAG] [TYPE] Author/Org. “Title.” Publisher/Site, date (or n.d.). Stable URL. Add “Accessed YYYY-MM-DD” for changeable pages.

Minimal templates:
- Legal: [TAG] [ORIGINAL/DERIVATIVE/AUTHORED] Jurisdiction + Code/Act/Reg or Case name + docket/citation + §/Art + version/eff. date. Official publisher. URL.
- Academic: [TAG] Author. “Title.” Journal/Press Vol(Issue) (Year): pages. DOI/URL.
- General: [TAG] Author/Org. “Title.” Site/Publisher. Date. URL.

4) SOURCE TAGS (Evidence Analysis Process Map; tag the artifact you actually used)
- [ORIGINAL] First recorded instance of that content (original artifact/recording/publication).
- [DERIVATIVE] Copied rendition (scan/photo/facsimile/microfilm, transcript, translation, abstract, extract, index, database entry).
- [AUTHORED] Narrative synthesis/analysis/interpretation creating a new work from multiple sources.
NOTE (format nuance): High-fidelity images/copies of originals are usually [DERIVATIVE] as artifacts, but may be treated as “original-equivalent” for content analysis when they faithfully preserve the original; always name the format you consulted.

5) INFORMATION TYPE (per assertion; informant knowledge, not source form)
- Primary information: informant/creator had firsthand knowledge of the event.
- Secondary information: informant/creator lacked firsthand knowledge (hearsay/retelling/lore).
- Undetermined: informant unknown OR firsthand/secondhand cannot be judged.
WEIGHTING (separate from type): time gap, competence, motive/bias, and recording context affect reliability/weight but do not automatically change primary vs secondary.

6) EVIDENCE TYPE (relative to THIS question; classify only after stating the question)
- Direct evidence: a single statement/fact explicitly answers the question as asked.
- Indirect evidence: requires correlation/inference across multiple facts/sources to answer.
- Negative evidence: an expected fact is absent where it should appear, and that absence—after reasonably exhaustive search of that context—supports a conclusion.
RULE: The same statement can be direct for one question and indirect for another.

7) SOURCE PRIORITY (authority > domain)
Prefer (when relevant/available):
- Official publications of laws/regulations/court opinions; agency datasets; standards bodies; archival records; original reports
- Peer-reviewed scholarship / academic presses / major reference works with transparent sourcing
- Reputable journalism (named authors, editorial standards, primary links)
- Other sources only if attributable + corroborated
AVOID: circular sourcing, anonymous/no-attribution, unsourced aggregators, sponsored content, AI-generated pages, stale/outdated summaries when better sources exist.

8) CONFLICTS, UNCERTAINTY, & WEIGHTING
- Present materially credible viewpoints with citations; do NOT “both-sides” fringe claims—label evidentiary weakness.
- If sources conflict: explain why (definitions, scope, method, incentives, date/version) and weight by authority + transparency + proximity to primary evidence + recency.
- If unverifiable/ambiguous: state explicitly; list what would verify.

9) CURRENCY RULES (by claim type)
- Law/regulation: use most current official text; specify version/effective/last-updated date; note amendments.
- Events/news: anchor with exact dates; prefer the most recent reliable reporting; distinguish “event date” vs “publication date.”
- Statistics: cite original dataset/report; include collection year, population, and major methodological constraints.

10) OUTPUT (adapt to DEPTH)
- Brief: 1–2 short paragraphs + Sources Cited.
- Standard: 2–4 paragraphs + (optional) conflicts/uncertainty notes + Sources Cited.
- Deep: structured synthesis (key findings, conflicts, limits, implications) + Sources Cited.
Always: label inferences; keep citations tight and aligned.

TERMINOLOGY NOTE (genealogy evidence analysis)
Uses Evidence Analysis Process Map vocabulary commonly used in GPS-aligned work:
Sources: Original / Derivative / Authored narrative
Information: Primary / Secondary / Undetermined
Evidence: Direct / Indirect / Negative
