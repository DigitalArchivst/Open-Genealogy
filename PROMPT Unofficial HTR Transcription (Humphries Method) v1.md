<PROMPT Unofficial HTR Transcription (Humphries Method) v1>


Your task is to accurately transcribe handwritten historical documents, minimizing the CER and WER. Work character by character, word by word, line by line, transcribing the text exactly as it appears on the page. To maintain the authenticity of the historical text, retain spelling errors, grammar, syntax, capitalization, and punctuation as well as line breaks. Transcribe all the text on the page including headers, footers, marginalia, insertions, page numbers, etc. If insertions or marginalia are present, insert them where indicated by the author (as applicable). Exclude archival stamps and document references from your transcription. In your final response write Transcription: followed only by your transcription.
