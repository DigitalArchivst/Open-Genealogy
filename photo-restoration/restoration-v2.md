# Universal Historical Photograph Restoration & Enhancement v2

Transform this damaged historical photograph into a pristine, museum-quality restoration as if perfectly preserved since creation and captured with period-appropriate professional equipment on fine-grain black and white film.

## ADAPTIVE RESTORATION PROTOCOL:

### 1. DAMAGE ASSESSMENT & REPAIR
**Identify, articulate, and eliminate ALL visible damage:**
- Scratches, creases, tears, cracks across entire image
- Missing emulsion, holes, or information gaps
- Stains, foxing, water damage, chemical deterioration  
- Dust, spots, fingerprints, surface contamination
- Fading, contrast loss, or tonal degradation
**Reconstruction principle:** Use photographic logic to restore missing information naturally

### 2. SUBJECT ENHANCEMENT (Adapt to image content)
**For ALL human subjects present:**
- Achieve crystalline focus on faces, especially eyes
- Restore natural skin texture appropriate to age
- Define individual hair strands where visible
- Preserve exact likeness, expressions, and relationships
- Enhance clothing textures and period details

**Compositional hierarchy:**
- Primary focus: Main subject(s) or central figures
- Secondary focus: Supporting elements and context
- Background: Maintain period atmosphere with appropriate detail

### 3. ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION
**Preserve and enhance ALL contextual elements:**
- Architecture: Buildings, doors, windows, structural details
- Signage: Text, lettering, decorative elements
- Nature: Trees, foliage, sky, ground surfaces
- Objects: Furniture, vehicles, tools, decorations
- Textures: Wood grain, fabric weaves, stone, metal

### 4. PHOTOGRAPHIC EXCELLENCE
**Tonal optimization:**
- Deep, rich blacks without crushing detail
- Clean whites maintaining texture information
- Full mid-tone range revealing all nuances
- Smooth gradations appropriate to film photography

**Sharpness hierarchy:**
- Critical sharpness on primary subjects
- Natural focus falloff based on original depth of field
- Edge acutance without digital artifacts
- Period-appropriate lens characteristics

### 5. PERIOD AUTHENTICITY
**Maintain temporal accuracy:**
- Preserve era-specific photographic qualities
- Retain original poses and social dynamics
- Keep architectural and fashion details period-correct
- Respect historical photographic techniques/limitations

### 6. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
**Quality standards:**
- Zero AI-generated anomalies or digital artifacts
- Natural film grain if originally present
- No plastic skin, over-smoothing, or face morphing
- Photographic realism throughout
- Complete elimination of all damage while preserving character

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Before restoration, the AI must:
1. Identify number and arrangement of subjects
2. Assess environmental/contextual elements
3. Determine probable time period
4. Evaluate damage types and severity
5. Recognize compositional priorities

## FINAL OBJECTIVE:
Produce an image that appears to have been:
- Perfectly preserved in optimal archival conditions
- Never damaged, folded, or deteriorated
- Professionally photographed with period equipment
- Scanned at maximum quality from pristine original

**CRITICAL:** Maintain absolute fidelity to original subjects, composition, and historical context while achieving supreme photographic clarity and complete damage removal.
</PROMPT>

This universal prompt:
- **Adapts automatically** to any number of subjects (1 to 20+ people)
- **Scales to any composition** (portrait, group, landscape, indoor/outdoor)
- **Handles any damage level** (minor spots to severe deterioration)
- **Preserves any time period** (1850s-1980s photography)
- **Maintains focus** on whatever is actually in the submitted image
- **Uses analytical approach** to identify what needs attention

The prompt intelligently adapts rather than prescribing specific elements, making it robust for any historical photograph while maintaining the high restoration standards you need.
