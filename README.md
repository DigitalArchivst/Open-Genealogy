## Quick Start

1. Pick a category above
2. Copy the recommended prompt into your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
3. Provide your input (document scan, photo, research question)
4. Follow the output structure

New here? The [Getting Started guide](GETTING-STARTED.md) walks through setup, first use, and common workflows.

## Featured: GPS Research Methodology

The **research/** folder contains prompts designed to follow the [Genealogical Proof Standard](https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/)—the professional methodology for evidence-based genealogical conclusions.

Key features:
- **Evidence Analysis Process Map**: Classifies sources (Original/Derivative/Authored), information (Primary/Secondary), and evidence (Direct/Indirect/Negative)
- **Epistemic transparency**: Separates what sources state from inference from uncertainty
- **Conflict resolution**: Explicit protocols for handling contradictory evidence

Aligned with the methodology described in:
- Mills, *Evidence Explained*, 4th ed. (2024)
- BCG, *Genealogy Standards*, 2nd ed. revised (2021)

## Benchmark

The **benchmark/** folder contains a framework for evaluating how well AI models follow GPS methodology. Includes comparative analysis of Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok.
