## Quick Start

1. Pick a category above
2. Copy the recommended prompt into your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
3. Provide your input (document scan, photo, research question)
4. Follow the output structure

## Featured: GPS Research Methodology

The **research/** folder contains prompts encoding the [Genealogical Proof Standard](https://bcgcertification.org/ethics-standards/)—the professional methodology for evidence-based genealogical conclusions.

Key features:
- **Evidence Analysis Process Map**: Classifies sources (Original/Derivative/Authored), information (Primary/Secondary), and evidence (Direct/Indirect/Negative)
- **Epistemic transparency**: Separates what sources state from inference from uncertainty
- **Conflict resolution**: Explicit protocols for handling contradictory evidence

Based on:
- Mills, *Evidence Explained*, 4th ed. (2024)
- BCG, *Genealogy Standards*, 2nd ed. revised (2021)

## Benchmark

The **benchmark/** folder contains a framework for evaluating how well AI models follow GPS methodology. Includes comparative analysis of Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok.
